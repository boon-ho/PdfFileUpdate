# PdfFileUpdate
This utility started as I venture to learn Python. I needed a utility to help me update Pdf file, mostly for signature.
Rather then paying for Adobe Pdf editor license, I need a simple utility to delete and add pages to pdf file. The 
utility also allow me to convert scan image pages (jpg, png etc ) to pdf.
Tested on Python 3.7.7.

##### Python packages required

* Pypdf4
* PIL
